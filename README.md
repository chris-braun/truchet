# Truchet

The output of this project is the [writeup](https://chris-braun.github.io/truchet/). Read the writeup for the backstory on `truchet.ts`. Then read `truchet.ts`. That's where all of the magic happens.

Beyond that, `main.ts` is a little bit of code to glue `index.html` and `truchet.ts` together. The rest of the files are for Vite and GitHub. Your favorite AI should be able to explain them. All of the files just mentioned can be safely ignored unless you are interested in those details.

## Installation

There's nothing to install unless you want to play with the code. In that case just clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chris-braun/truchet.git
```

And then install its dependencies.

```sh
cd truchet
npm install
```

## Usage

This is a vanilla-ts Vite project. [Follow this link](https://vite.dev/guide/) to find out more about Vite. Run truchet to see the writeup. The same writeup as the [project's page](https://chris-braun.github.io/truchet/).

```sh
npm run dev
```
