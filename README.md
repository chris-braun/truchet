# Truchet

Truchet documents a method for statically coloring Truchet tiles. The output of this project is the [writeup](https://chris-braun.github.io/truchet/). Please read the writeup if you're interested in the backstory on `truchet.ts`. Next read `truchet.ts`. That's where the magic happens.

The other file is `main.ts` which is a little bit of code to glue `index.html` and `truchet.ts` together. The rest of the files are for Vite and GitHub. All of the files just mentioned can be safely ignored unless you are interested in those details.

## Installation

There's nothing to install unless you want to play with the code. In that case just clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chris-braun/truchet.git
```

And then install its dependencies.

```sh
cd truchet
npm install
```

## Usage

This is a vanilla-ts Vite project. [Follow this link](https://vite.dev/guide/) to find out more about Vite. Run truchet to see the writeup. The same writeup as the [project's page](https://chris-braun.github.io/truchet/).

```sh
npm run dev
```
